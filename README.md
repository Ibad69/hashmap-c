# HashMap 

This is in no way a complete repository at this particular I am just practicing out there and this is a very rough implementation that I could come up with for hash tables or hash maps in c there are a lot more refinements and optimizations that are needed in this, just putting it out there!

I have YET TO IMPLEMENT LINEAR PROBING IN THIS WILL DEEFINITELY DO THIS SOMETIME SOON!

### main.c is generally kind of a benchmark / testing file for my own use case, has some leaks here and there with strdup
